# Semantic Segmentation

üöß This is still under development üèó

Semantic segmentation has become an important component of self-driving vehicles. It allows the car to understand the surroundings by classifying every pixel of the input image.

## Running...
To run inference on the pre-trained models, please use `segmentor.py`. 

	from segmentor import Segmentor
	seg = Segmentor()
	cls_output, img_viz = seg.semantic_segmentation(image=image, visualization=True)

`cls_output` is the pixel-wise classification result for all the categories. `img_viz` is a RGB image generated based on `cls_output`

The best way to run some actual test is using `test.py`. You must specify the image path by changing the `path` variable. 

The pre-trained weights are stored in the `./weights` directory.

## Training

`train.py` is the training script. `utils.py` contains all the categories (classes). You can modify them based on your dataset. 

*training doesn't work very well.* I trying to fix the issue. 

## Models

The goal is to achieve real time semantic segmentation. Therefore, choosing & developing the appropriate model is critical. 
I experimented with UNet and ENet, but realized drawbacks to both of these architectures. I eventually landed on ICNet, which
stands for image cascade network

Here is a simple benchmark comparison between ICNet and other popular semantic segmentation models. These images and visualizations
are from the original ICNet paper, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08545).
